# Hello-World-bez-bibliotek-w-C

Hello World in C. Nothing particularly interestint BUT, there are no libraries included, no printfs, no puts, no couts or anything boring like that. There are also no assembly calls (at least you can't see them). Have a look at it and try to figure out what is going on. I have also included an explanation file if that's ever needed. Good Luck :D
